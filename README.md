# Image_classification

Here I implemented image classification on `CIFAR-10` dataset, which comes preinstalled with tensorflow dataset. After a little preprocessing of data, I plotted some examples from the dataset. I make 2 different model, using 3 and 10 class of the dataset. Then I trained 2 different model. Both models are trained for 20 epochs. The model with 3 classes has an accuracy of 90% on val set. Finally I plotted some image to test the model performance.     
The source code in python is added in the 2 different notebook. The saved model is available on the model folder.
